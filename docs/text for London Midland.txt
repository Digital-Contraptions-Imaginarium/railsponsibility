Dear London Midland,

I would like to be able to donate my delay repay compensations to charity. 

I have noticed though that you require the vouchers you issue for compensation to be marked with a name and signature. I would like to understand what's that for and if those need to be my name and signature. Ideally I would let you ship the vouchers directly to my charity of choice, but then I would not be able to sign them.

Can you explain / tell me more?

Thanks,

G.
